# Face-Recognition-and-attendance-project
The Attendance project is an application that uses a webcam to detect faces and record attendance in real-time. The system detects faces and recognizes them by comparing them with a set of known faces. When a match is found, the name of the person is displayed on the screen along with a green rectangle around their face.
